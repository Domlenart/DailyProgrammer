# Description

Our maze explorer has some wierd rules for finding the
exit and we are going to tell him if it is possible
with his rules to get out.

Our explorer has the following rules:

  * I always walk 6 blocks straight on and then turn 180Â° and start walking 6 blocks again
  * If a wall is in my way I turn to the right, if that not possible I turn to the left and if that is not possible I turn back from where I came.

# Notes/Hints

Making a turn does not count as a step

# Several bonuses

## Bonus 1:

Generate your own (possible) maze.

## Bonus 2:

Animate it and make a nice gif out off it.

## Bonus 3:

Be the little voice in the head:

Instead of turning each 6 steps, you should implement a
way to not turn if that would means that you can make
it to the exit.
