# Description

Simplify square roots in the form `(a sqrt(b))/(c
sqrt(d))`. A simplified radical should have no square
roots in the denominator and no number in a square root
should have a square factor. For example, the input `2
5 5 10` for `a b c d`, respectively, should simplify to
`1 2 5` where a=1, b=2, and c=5.
