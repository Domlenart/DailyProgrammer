Given a string containing the English word for one of
the single-digit numbers, return the number _without
using any of the words in your code_. Examples:

eng_to_dec('zero') # => 0  
eng_to_dec('four') # => 4

Note: there is no right or wrong way to complete this
challenge. Be creative with your solutions!
