# Description:

Given a string of words and a string of letters. Find
the largest string(s) that are in the 1st string of
words that can be formed from the letters in the 2nd
string.

  * Letters can be only used once. So if the string has "a b c" then words like "aaa" and "bbb" do not work because there is only 1 "a" or "b" to be used.
  * If you have tie for the longest strings then output all the possible strings.
  * If you find no words at all then output "No Words Found"
