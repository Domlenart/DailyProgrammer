# Description

Now that we have the basic, let's review something else
[Elementary cellular
automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)

I could explain it, but over at
[Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html)
they do a pretty decent job.

# Formal Inputs & Outputs

  * the size of the tape/array
  * the number of rows to output
  * the number of the rule

# Bonus

Add 2 rules by a logic opperator (and, or, nor, nand,
xor, xnor).

For this you keep both outputs in memory and only the
output goes trough the logic comparison for output.

Examples will be added later

# Notes/Hints

I know this has been done before and this isn't very
new... but it will all come together at the last
challenge this week.

# Finally

Have a good challenge idea?
