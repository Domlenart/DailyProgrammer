## **Description**

As we know English uses Latin alphabet consisting of 26
characters, both upper- and lower-case:

[code]

    Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz
    
[/code]

However, many other languages use its modified version,
with some of the letters removed and additional
diacritics added to some of them. For instance, Czech
alphabet has following additional characters:

[code]

    Áá Čč Ďď Éé Ěě Íí Ňň Óó Řř Šš Ťť Úú Ůů Ýý Žž
    
[/code]

The worst of all is probably Vietnamese:

[code]

    Áá Àà Ãã Ảả Ạạ Ââ Ấấ Ầầ Ẫẫ Ẩẩ Ậậ Ăă Ắắ Ằằ Ẵẵ Ẳẳ Ặặ Đđ Éé Èè Ẽẽ Ẻẻ Ẹẹ Êê Ếế Ềề Ễễ Ểể Ệệ

    Úú Ùù Ũũ Ủủ Ụụ Ưư Ứứ Ừừ Ữữ Ửử Ựự Ýý Ỳỳ Ỹỹ Ỷỷ Ỵỵ
    
[/code]

Your job is to write a method `twistUp` which "twists
up" a string, making it as much filled with diacritics
as possible.

## **Input**

Your input will consist of one string of any letters of
the English alphabet, digits and special characters.
Characters that cannot be diactriticized should be
returned in its original form.

## **Output**

Output will consist of a modified text.

## **Sample input**

[code]

    For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? 
    Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? 
    If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, 
    and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?
    
[/code]

## **Sample output**

[code]

    Ƒǒṝ, āᶂťȅŗ ąľḷ, ħṓẃ ᶁớ ẅē ḵȵȭŵ ŧⱨąť ȶẁô ǎǹḍ ẗŵȫ ᶆầᶄĕ ḟõṵɍ?

[/code]

## **Notes**

  * If your browser/compiler/console cannot display diacritics, switch encoding to UTF-8.
  * Other than diacritics, you can use similar-looking characters like Cyrillic`И` for `N`

## **Bonus challenges**

Make your `twistUp` method take not only letters of
English alphabet, but all the letters:

[code]

    Dżdżystym rankiem gżegżółki i piegże, zamiast wziąć się za dżdżownice,
    nażarły się na czczo miąższu rzeżuchy i rzędem rzygały do rozżarzonej brytfanny.

[/code]

Twisted up characters don't need to be the same every
time!

    Boy, this challenge sure is fun.

[/code]

Write an additional `untwist` method which takes a
twisted up text and converts its characters into plain
Latin:

[code]

    The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, 
    and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.
    
[/code]
