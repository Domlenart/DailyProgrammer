# Description

During online gaming (or any video game that requires
teamwork) , there is often times that you need to speak
to your teammates. Given the nature of the game, it may
be inconvenient to say full sentences and it's for this
reason that a lot of games have acronyms in place of
sentences that are regularly said.

Example

[code]

    gg : expands to 'Good Game'
    brb : expands to 'be right back'
    
[/code]

and so on...

This is even evident on IRC's and other chat systems.

However, all this abbreviated text can be confusing and
intimidating for someone new to a game. They're not
going to instantly know what 'gl hf all'(good luck have
fun all) means. It is with this problem that you come
in.

You are tasked with converting an abbreviated sentence
into its full version.

# Inputs & Outputs
