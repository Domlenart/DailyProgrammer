# Description

There is a light in a room which lights up only when
someone is in the room (think motion detector). You are
given a set of intervals in entrance and exit times as
single integers, and expected to find how long the
light has been on. When the times overlap, you need to
find the time between the smallest and the biggest
numbers in that interval.

# Input Description

You'll be given a set of two integers per line telling
you the time points that someone entered and exited the
room, respectively. Each line is a visitor, each block
is a room. Example:

[code]

    1 3
    2 3
    4 5
    
[/code]

# Output Description

Your program should report the number of hours the
lights would be on. From the above example:

[code]

    3
