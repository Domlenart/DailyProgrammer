# Description

In this challenge, you will be given a set of circles,
defined by their centers and radii. Your goal is to
find the bounding rectangle which will contain all of
the circles completely.

Write a program that determines the vertices of the
bounding rectangle with sides parallel to the axes.

# Input Description

Each line will contain a comma separated center and
radius for a circle.

# Output Description

The format of the output will be comma separated
coordinates, rounded to 3 decimal places.

# Challenge Input

[code]

    1,1,2
    2,2,0.5
    -1,-3,2
    5,2,1

# Bonus

For the bonus, we will rotate the axis for the bounding
rectangle. The first line of input will now be a vector
determining the direction of one edge of the bounding
rectangle.
