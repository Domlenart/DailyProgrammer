# Description

In mathematics, a Ruthâ€“Aaron pair consists of two
consecutive integers (e.g. 714 and 715) for which the
sums of the _distinct_ prime factors of each integer
are equal. For example, we know that (714, 715) is a
valid Ruth-Aaron pair because its distinct prime
factors are:

[code]

    714 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 17
    715 = 5 * 11 * 13
    
[/code]

and the sum of those is both 29:

[code]

    2 + 3 + 7 + 17 = 5 + 11 + 13 = 29
    
[/code]

The name was given by Carl Pomerance, a mathematician
at the University of Georgia, for Babe Ruth and Hank
Aaron, as Ruth's career regular-season home run total
was 714, a record which Aaron eclipsed on April 8,
1974, when he hit his 715th career home run. A student
of one of Pomerance's colleagues noticed that the sums
of the distinct prime factors of 714 and 715 were
equal.

Your task today is to determine if a pair of numbers is
indeed a valid Ruth-Aaron pair.

# Input Description

You'll be given a single integer _N_ on one line to
tell you how many pairs to read, and then that many
pairs as two-tuples. For example:

[code]

    3
    (714,715)
    (77,78)
    (20,21)
    
[/code]

# Output Description

Your program should emit if the numbers are valid Ruth-
Aaron pairs. Example:

[code]

    (714,715) VALID
    (77,78) VALID
    (20,21) NOT VALID
    
[/code]

# Chalenge Input

[code]

    4
    (5,6) 
    (2107,2108) 
    (492,493) 
    (128,129) 
    
[/code]

# Challenge Output

[code]

    (5,6) VALID
    (2107,2108) VALID
    (492,493) VALID
    (128,129) NOT VALID
    
[/code]
