# Description

A prime number is any integer greater than 1 which can
only be evenly divided by 1 or itself. For this
challenge, you will output two numbers: the nearest
prime below the input, and the nearest prime above it.

# Input Description

The input will be a number on each line, called _n_.

# Output Description

The format of the output will be:

> _p1 < n < p2_

where _p1_ is the smaller prime, _p2_ is the larger
prime and _n_ is the input.

If _n_ already is a prime, the output will be:

> _n_ is prime.

# Challenge Input

[code]

    270  
    541  
    993  
    649
    
[/code]

# Challenge Output

[code]

    269 < 270 < 271  
    541 is prime.  
    991 < 993 < 997  
    647 < 649 < 653
    
[/code]

# Bonus

Write the program to work for numbers with big gaps to
the nearest primes. This requires a clever solution and
cannot be efficiently bruteforced.
