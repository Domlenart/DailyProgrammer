# Description

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams
of 11 players each on a field at the centre of which is
a rectangular pitch. The game is played by 120 million
players in many countries, making it the world's second
most popular sport!

There are 2 batsmen standing on two bases and the ball
is played to the strike base. Batsmen run between their
bases to increases their 'runs'. If a batsman gets out,
a new batsman arrives to their base.  
This is only a simplified version of the rules

Let's look at a typical score: 1.2wW6.2b34  
There are 5 types of characters:

  * (number) - The player on strike acquires this many runs to his name.  

  * '.' \- A _dot ball_. No runs.  

  * 'b' \- A _bye_ , 1 run to the team but not to any particular batsman.  

  * 'w' \- A _wide_ , 1 run to the team but not to any particular batsman.  
The difference between 'w' and 'b' is that a 'b' counts
as a ball but 'w' is not a legal ball.

  * 'W' \- Strike batsman is _out_. A new player takes his place, if there is any player left to play out of 11 available. If not, the innings is complete. 

Additional Rules:

  * If the striker scores an odd number, that means he reaches the other base and the batsmen have exchanged their base. If he scores 2, he runs twice and comes back to the same base.  

  * The batsmen exchange their bases after 6 _legal_ balls called an _over_ , that means a 'w' doesn't count as a ball. So a score like '1..2.www' is still one over as it has only 5 _legal_ balls.
