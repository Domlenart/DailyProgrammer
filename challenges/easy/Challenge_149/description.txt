# _(Easy)_ : Disemvoweler

Disemvoweling means removing the vowels from text. (For
this challenge, the letters a, e, i, o, and u are
considered vowels, and the letter y is not.) The idea
is to make text difficult but not impossible to read,
for when somebody posts something so idiotic you want
people who are reading it to get extra frustrated.

To make things even harder to read, we'll remove spaces
too. For example, this string:

[code]

    two drums and a cymbal fall off a cliff
    
[/code]

can be disemvoweled to get:

[code]

    twdrmsndcymblfllffclff
    
[/code]

We also want to keep the vowels we removed around (in
their original order), which in this case is:

[code]

    ouaaaaoai
    
[/code]

# Formal Inputs & Outputs

## Input description

A string consisting of a series of words to disemvowel.
It will be all lowercase (letters a-z) and without

handle is spaces.

## Output description

Two strings, one of the disemvoweled text (spaces
removed), and one of all the removed vowels.

In principle it may be possible to reconstruct the
original text from the disemvoweled text. If you want
to try it, check out this week's Intermediate
challenge!
