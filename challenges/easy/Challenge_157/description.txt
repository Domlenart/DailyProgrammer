# Description:

The world championship in Tic Tac Toe, The X-Games is
underway. We have been asked to write a program to see
if there is a winning move possible. This tool will be
used by live commentators to use in their play by play.

# input

(Next player's Move either an X or an O)

(3 x 3 grid showing the current game)

The grid can have 3 characters

  * X for spot held by the X player
  * O for spot held by the O player
  * \- for an empty spot

## Example Input 1:

[code]

    X
    XX-
    -XO
    OO-
    
[/code]

## Example Input 2:

[code]

    O
    O-X
    -OX
    ---
    
[/code]

## Example Input 3:

[code]

    X
    --O
    OXX
    ---
    
[/code]

# Output:

there is no winning move print out "No winning move"

## Example Output 1:

[code]

    XXX
    -XO
    OO-
    
[/code]

## Example Output 2:

[/code]

# Extra Challenge:

  * Boards where several moves can "win" display all boards showing the winning moves with a message saying how many wins are possible
  * Boards with no winning move -- suggest a "block" move the player should make instead with a message saying "No winning move: Block here"
