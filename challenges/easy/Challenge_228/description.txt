# Description

A handful of words have their letters in alphabetical
order, that is nowhere in the word do you change
direction in the word if you were to scan along the
English alphabet. An example is the word "almost",
which has its letters in alphabetical order.

Your challenge today is to write a program that can
determine if the letters in a word are in alphabetical
order.

As a bonus, see if you can find words spelled in
_reverse_ alphebatical order.

# Input Description

You'll be given one word per line, all in standard
English. Examples:

[code]

    almost
    cereal
    
[/code]

# Output Description

Your program should emit the word and if it is in order
or not. Examples:

[code]

    almost IN ORDER
    cereal NOT IN ORDER
    
[/code]
