A word ladder is a sequence of words made by changing
one letter at a time. For example:

[code]

    cold → cord → card → ward → warm
    
[/code]

Given a word, list all the words that can appear next
to it in a word ladder, using [this list of 3,807 four-
letter words](http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB). Sample
input:

[code]

    puma
    
[/code]

Sample output:

[code]

    duma
    pima
    puja
    pula
    pump
    puna
    pupa
    
[/code]

How many words from the list can appear next to the
word `best` in a word ladder?

**Bonus 1:** One word in the list has 33 other words
that can appear next to it. What is this word?

**Bonus 2:** How many different words can be reached,
starting from `best`, in 3 or fewer steps?
