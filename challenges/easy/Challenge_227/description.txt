#  **(Easy)** : Square Spirals

Take a square grid, and put a cross on the center
point, like this:

[code]

    + + + + +
    
    + + + + +
    
    + + X + +
    
    + + + + +
    
    + + + + +
    
[/code]

The grid is 5-by-5, and the cross indicates point 1.
Let's call the top-left corner location (1, 1), so the
center point is at location (3, 3). Now, place another
cross to the right, and trace the path:

[code]

    + + + + +
    
    + + + + +
    
    + + X-X +
    
    + + + + +
    
    + + + + +
    
[/code]

This second point (point 2) is now at location (4, 3).
If you continually move around anticlockwise as much as
you can from this point, you will form a square spiral,
as this diagram shows the beginning of:

[code]

    + + + + +
    
    + X-X-X .
      |   | .
    + X X-X .
      |     |
    + X-X-X-X
    
    + + + + +
    
[/code]

Your challenge today is to do two things: convert a
point number to its location on the spiral, and vice
versa.

# Formal Inputs and Outputs

## Input Specification

On the first line, you'll be given a number **S**. This
is the size of the spiral. If **S** equals 5, then the
grid is a 5-by-5 grid, as shown in the demonstration
above. **S** will always be an odd number.

You will then be given one of two inputs on the next
line:

  * You'll be given a single number **N** \- this is the point number of a point on the spiral.
  * You'll be given two numbers **X** and **Y** (on the same line, separated by a space) - this is the location of a point on the spiral.

## Output Description

If you're given the point number of a point, work out
its location. If you're given a location, find out its
point number.

# Sample Inputs and Outputs

## Example 1

(Where is 8 on this spiral?)

[code]

    5-4-3
    |   |
    6 1-2
    |    
    7-8-9
    
[/code]

### Input

[code]

    3
    8
    
[/code]

### Output

[code]

    (2, 3)
    
[/code]

## Example 2

This corresponds to the top-left point (1, 1) in [this
7-by-7
grid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Ulam_spiral_howto_all_numbers.svg/811px-
Ulam_spiral_howto_all_numbers.svg.png).

### Input

[code]

    7
    1 1
    
[/code]

### Output

[code]

    37
    
[/code]

## Example 3

### Input

[code]

    11
    50
    
[/code]

### Output

[code]

    (10, 9)
    
[/code]

## Example 4

### Input

[code]

    9
    6 8
    
[/code]

### Output

[code]

    47
    
[/code]

If your solution can't solve the next two inputs before
the heat death of the universe, don't worry.

## Example 5

Let's test how fast your solution is!

### Input

    557614022
    
[/code]

### Output

[code]

    (512353188, 512346213)
    
[/code]

## Example 6

### Input

[code]

    234653477
    11777272 289722
    
[/code]

### Output
