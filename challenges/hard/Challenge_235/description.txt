# Description

Based on [Challenge #227 Contiguous
chains](http://redd.it/3gpjn3) ... but with a chain
meaning 1 _continuous_ strand, where each link in the
chain can be connected to _at most_ two neighbors. For
the purposes of this problem, chains can only be
contiguous if they connect horizontally of vertically,
not diagonally (which is the same original constraint).

For example, the input:

[code]

    4 9
    xxxx xxxx
       xxx   
    x   x   x
    xxxxxxxxx
    
[/code]

has at least 3 chains, with several valid layouts for
the chains. One possible layout that shows 3 chains:

[code]

    1111 2222
       112
    3   1   3
    333333333
    
[/code]

Another way to find 3:

[code]

    1111 1111
       111
    2   2   3
    222223333
    
[/code]

There is also a valid set of 4 chains:

[code]

    1111 2222
       111
    3   3   4
    333334444
    
[/code]

but 4 is not a correct (minimal) output, because 3 is
possible.

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to
find the minimum number of chains in a given input.
