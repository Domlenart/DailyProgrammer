# Description

The puzzle is a 4x4 grid of numbers between 1 and 5.
4-connected tiles of same number form a group. For
example, the following grid has five groups:

[code]

    1 2 2 1
    1 3 3 1
    1 3 3 2
    2 2 2 2
    
[/code]

A "move" increments or decrements a group by 1,
possibly merging it with other groups. Given a
particular graph, your program will find the optimal
number of moves needed to merge the entire grid into a
single group. The above example takes just two moves:

  1. Decrement the center group, merging with both "2" groups.
  2. Decrement this new larger group, merging it with both "1" groups.

You can play with this interactively [in an online
prototype](http://entibo.fr/lvlr/). This challenge was
inspired by [this post in
