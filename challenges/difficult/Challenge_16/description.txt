You all know about [O'Neill's
algorithm](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/%7Eoneill/papers/Sieve-
JFP.pdf)

write a program such that you compute primes for a
given input by the user using it.

edit: if anyone has any suggestions for the subreddit,
kindly post it in the feedback thread posted a day
before. It will be easier to assess. Thank you.
